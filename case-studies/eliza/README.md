# 🍷 Eliza

## What is Eliza?

Eliza is a chatbot program developed in the 1960s by computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum. It was one of the first natural language processing programs that attempted to simulate human-like conversation. Eliza was specifically designed to emulate a psychotherapist. It uses pattern matching and rephrasing techniques to turn the user's statements into open-ended questions that encourage them to explore their thoughts and feelings.

Although Eliza's responses are simple and scripted, it was a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, paving the way for the more advanced conversational agents we see today.

### **Fun Fact about Eliza**

Did you know that Eliza was actually named after Eliza Doolittle, the main character in the musical "My Fair Lady"? Joseph Weizenbaum was a fan of the musical and named his chatbot after Eliza Doolittle because he saw similarities between the character's transformation and the idea of a computer program that could simulate human-like conversation. In fact, in the early versions of the program, Eliza was even programmed to say "How do you do?" just like Eliza Doolittle in the musical!

Here's an excerpt of a conversation between Eliza and a woman taken from PAIP,

> Men are all alike.&#x20;
>
> IN WHAT WAY&#x20;
>
> They're always bugging us about something or another.&#x20;
>
> CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC&#x20;
>
> Well, my boyfriend made me come here.&#x20;
>
> YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE&#x20;
>
> He says I'm depressed much of the time.&#x20;
>
> I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED
>
> It' s true. I am unhappy.&#x20;
>
> DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY&#x20;
>
> I need some help, that much seems certain.&#x20;
>
> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP&#x20;
>
> Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.&#x20;
>
> TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY

Weizenbaum explains this appearance is an illusion, and the program has finessed the difficult task of understanding by carefully recognizing, transforming, and echoing pieces of the input. Interesting, isn't it?
