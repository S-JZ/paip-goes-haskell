# PAIP GOes Haskell

Implementations of early AI programs from the fantastic textbook 'Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming' by Peter Norvig, originally written in Lisp, in Haskell and Golang.

### :book: About PAIP

### :star: Why PAIP Go-es Haskell? \~ Motivation

LISP, Haskell and Golang are entirely new languages that we are picking up during the course of this project. We intend to analyze the different forms of expression, the frame of thinking, and the logical approaches taken by these languages. The goal is to learn about the techniques illustrated by the case studies in the book and use them to solve a wider range of problems.

### :pencil: Challenges Faced and Learnings

Language-wise challenges, learnings, and knowledge gathered can be found in the Go Learnings and Haskell Learnings Wiki Pages respectively.

### :construction: What's next for PAIP Go-es Haskell?

* [x] Implement APIs for individual case studies
* [x] Set up a website to showcase case studies
* [ ] Implement more case studies or programs from the book
* [ ] Rewrite some of the Lisp programs from the book using library functions
